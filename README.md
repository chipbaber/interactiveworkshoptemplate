# Interactive Workshop Template

This code base was written in 2013 to showcase use cases and steps inside interactive workshops. At the time it was my first attempt at HTML5, CSS3 with Jquery. And like most things it went live, has run for years but as I look back on the code I see how much I have learned since then. Our goal is to update this app so it is responsive, runs in github pages and leverages more modern techniques.
